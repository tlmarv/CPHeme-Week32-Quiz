        "Obturator",
        "Femoral"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is the inferior gluteal nerve (C). Weakness in climbing stairs or jumping indicates a problem with powerful hip extension, a function of the gluteus maximus muscle, which is innervated by the inferior gluteal nerve. Although the hamstrings, innervated by the tibial nerve, assist in hip extension, they are not the primary muscles for these powerful motions. The superior gluteal nerve innervates gluteus medius and minimus, which stabilize the pelvis. The obturator nerve innervates the adductors, and the femoral nerve innervates muscles involved in knee extension."

        "Flexion of the thigh"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is flexion of the leg (D). The ischial tuberosity is the origin of the hamstring muscles, which are crucial for flexing the leg at the knee and extending the thigh at the hip. A fracture to the ischial tuberosity would impair the hamstrings, thereby affecting these movements. Other functions, such as abduction of the thigh (by gluteus minimus and medius), dorsiflexion of the foot (by tibialis anterior), and extension of the leg (by quadriceps), are not affected by an injury to the ischial tuberosity."

It stabilizes the ankle and resists eversion. Forced eversion can result in a sprain of the deltoid ligament. The anterior talofibular and calcaneofibular ligaments are on the lateral side of the ankle and are more commonly injured with inversion. The anterior tibiofibular ligament supports the distal tibiofibular joint, and the plantar calcaneonavicular ligament (spring ligament) supports the medial longitudinal arch of the foot."

    "question": "A patient with a fracture to the left upper tibia was treated with a plaster cast. A few days later they started to develop progressive numbness over the dorsum of the foot and weakness in dorsiflexion. The cast was quickly changed and the signs were attributed to nerve compression. The compressed nerve was most likely the:",

        "Sciatic",
        "Femoral",
        "Common fibular"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 4,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is the common fibular nerve (E). The common fibular nerve branches into the deep fibular nerve, which innervates the anterior compartment of the leg responsible for dorsiflexion, and the superficial fibular nerve, which provides sensation to the dorsum of the foot. Compression of the common fibular nerve can result in both weakness in dorsiflexion and sensory loss over the dorsum of the foot."

    "question": "A long-distance runner complained of swelling and pain of his shin. At physical examination, skin testing showed normal cutaneous sensation of the leg. However, muscular strength tests showed marked weakness of dorsiflexion and impaired inversion of the foot. Which nerve serves the muscles involved?",
    "choices": [
        "Common fibular",
        "Deep fibular",
        "Sciatic",
        "Superficial fibular",
        "Tibial"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is the deep fibular nerve (B). The deep fibular nerve innervates the anterior compartment of the leg, including the tibialis anterior muscle, which is responsible for dorsiflexion and inversion of the foot. Weakness in dorsiflexion with preserved sensation in most of the leg suggests involvement of the deep fibular nerve rather than the common fibular nerve, which would affect a broader area."

    "question": "A car strikes a pedestrian on the lateral side of their leg. Following the accident, they have 'foot drop.' Their foot hangs loosely in plantar flexion when they raise it off the ground. They can still invert their foot weakly, but cannot evert it. They can flex but not extend their toes. Which nerve is most likely to have been crushed in their accident?",
    "choices": [
        "Common fibular",
        "Tibial",

        "Medial plantar",
        "Sciatic"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is the common fibular nerve (A). Damage to the common fibular nerve affects its two branches, the deep and superficial fibular nerves, which innervate the anterior and lateral compartments of the leg. This results in foot drop due to loss of dorsiflexion, inability to evert the foot (lateral compartment), and inability to extend the toes (anterior compartment). Weak inversion is still possible due to the tibialis posterior muscle, which is innervated by the tibial nerve."

    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is the popliteal artery (C). The popliteal artery lies deepest in the popliteal fossa and is closely adjacent to the posterior side of the knee joint, making it vulnerable to laceration by a posteriorly displaced distal femur fragment. The popliteal vein and tibial nerve are more superficial, and the common fibular nerve descends toward the fibular neck on the lateral side of the fossa."

    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is the calcaneal tendon (A). The gastrocnemius and soleus muscles insert on the calcaneus via the calcaneal tendon (Achilles tendon), which is the primary structure responsible for plantar flexion of the foot. Rupture of this tendon leads to significant weakness in plantar flexion. Other muscles listed have different actions, such as eversion, dorsiflexion, and flexion of specific toes."

    "question": "Your patient was struck by a car's bumper as she crossed the street, and her fibular neck is broken. After the bone has healed, she has 'foot drop', i.e., she cannot dorsiflex her foot, and so it flops onto the ground during walking. Denervation (paralysis) of which of the following muscles would be associated with foot drop?",
    "choices": [

        "Tibialis anterior",
        "Popliteus"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is tibialis anterior (D). Tibialis anterior is the major dorsiflexor of the foot, and paralysis of this muscle results in foot drop. It is located in the anterior compartment of the leg and is innervated by the deep fibular nerve, a branch of the common fibular nerve. Damage to the common fibular nerve, especially near the fibular neck, leads to weakness or loss of dorsiflexion, causing the foot to drop. Other muscles listed primarily contribute to plantarflexion or eversion."

        "Adductor hallucis"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is fibularis longus (D). A fracture at the fibular neck may cause injury to the superficial fibular nerve, which innervates the lateral compartment of the leg, including fibularis longus and fibularis brevis, both of which are responsible for foot eversion. The superficial fibular nerve also provides sensation to the dorsum of the foot. Since foot drop is absent, the deep fibular nerve (responsible for dorsiflexion) is likely intact, confirming the issue is isolated to the superficial fibular nerve."

    "explanation": "The correct answer is Piriformis and superior gemellus (E). This patient has signs of sciatica, including radiating pain from the lower back and buttock down the leg. Sciatica is caused by inflammation or compression of the sciatic nerve, which passes between the piriformis and superior gemellus muscles as it leaves the pelvis."

    "question": "Which of the following clinical presentations would you least expect to see in a patient with compartment syndrome?",
    "choices": [
        "Burning pain",
        "Inability to move the affected extremity",
        "Joint stiffness",
        "Loss of peripheral pulse",
        "Tingling sensation"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is joint stiffness (C). All choices but C are symptoms common to compartment syndrome (recall the five Ps). Increased interstitial pressure causing compression of blood vessels supplying the muscles, resulting in burning pain (A) is the most common. Inability to move the affected extremity (B) describes paralysis, loss of peripheral pulse (D) describes pulselessness, and tingling sensation (E) describes paresthesia. In contrast, joint stiffness is a more common symptom of arthritis."

    "question": "A 20-year-old man is rushed to the hospital following a collision while ice skating, after which he was unable to move his left leg. In the emergency department, he is diagnosed with a left tibial fracture and sent home with a cast. The next day, the patient returns to the emergency department describing worsening pain in his left leg that does not improve when he takes ibuprofen. The pain is so excruciating that he vomits when his lower left leg is touched. On physical examination, the physician notes that the patient's left leg is white and there are no left foot or ankle pulses. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for the patient’s condition?",
    "choices": [
        "Fasciotomy",
        "IV fluids",
        "Oxygen and analgesics",
        "Physical therapy",
        "Surgical removal of abnormal bony growth"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is fasciotomy (A). The patient is likely experiencing compartment syndrome after a long bone fracture, based on the history and findings of paleness and pulselessness in the same extremity. The definitive treatment is fasciotomy. Oxygen and analgesics (C) may be used as an adjunctive therapy, but given that the patient is presenting with a rather severe case (and is already displaying signs of pallor and pulselessness) and is unresponsive to ibuprofen, emergency fasciotomy is indicated. IV fluids (B) are an appropriate treatment for rhabdomyolysis. Physical therapy (D) and surgical removal of abnormal bony growth (E) are suitable treatments for myositis ossificans."

    "question": "A 26-year-old woman comes to the physician because of painful paresthesia in her right foot. Examination shows decreased sensation in the first interdigital space and a hallux valgus deformity. This patient's paresthesia is most likely caused by compression of which of the following nerves?",
    "choices": [
        "Superficial fibular nerve",
        "Tibial nerve",
        "Deep fibular nerve",
        "Sural nerve",
        "Saphenous nerve",
        "Medial plantar nerve"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is the deep fibular nerve. The deep fibular nerve provides sensory innervation to the skin between the first two toes. It also provides motor innervation to the muscles of the anterior compartment of the leg (e.g., tibialis anterior, extensor hallucis longus, extensor digitorum longus), which dorsiflex the toes and ankle joint. Injury to this nerve can result in a high-stepping gait. Deep fibular nerve compression can be caused by tight-fitting shoes, which are suggested by this patient's hallux valgus deformity (bunion). It may also occur following trauma, especially navicular fracture."

    "question": "A 51-year-old woman with hyperlipidemia comes to the physician because of weakness for one month. At the end of the day, she feels too fatigued to cook dinner or carry a laundry basket up the stairs. She also complains of double vision after she reads for long periods of time. All of her symptoms improve with rest. Her only medication is pravastatin. Physical examination shows drooping of the upper eyelids. Strength is initially 5/5 in the upper and lower extremities but decreases to 4/5 after a few minutes of sustained resistance. Sensation to light touch is intact and deep tendon reflexes are normal. Which of the following best describes the pathogenesis of this patient's condition?",
    "choices": [
        "Type II hypersensitivity reaction",
        "Peripheral nerve demyelination",
        "Impaired acetylcholine release",
        "Adverse drug effect",
        "Anterior horn cell destruction"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is type II hypersensitivity reaction (A). In myasthenia gravis, autoantibodies bind to post-synaptic acetylcholine receptors (AChR) at the neuromuscular junction, resulting in the inhibition of these receptors and impairing the process of neuromuscular transmission. This autoimmune, antibody-mediated cellular dysfunction is a hallmark of type II hypersensitivity reactions. Other examples include Graves disease and pemphigus vulgaris."

    "question": "An 18-year-old male military cadet comes to the physician because of bilateral lower extremity pain that began shortly after enlisting 5 months ago. The patient describes the pain as a dull ache most notable during his daily training routine. The pain used to dissipate while training, but now resolves slowly with rest. The pain does not interfere with his daily non-exertional activities, including ambulating. Medical history is otherwise unremarkable. Physical examination reveals diffuse tenderness along the medial border of the distal lower extremities. There is no lower extremity warmth, swelling, or overlying skin changes. Muscle strength in the lower extremity is normal. Pedal pulses are intact. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
        "Popliteal artery entrapment",
        "Chronic exertional compartment syndrome",
        "Common fibular neuropathy",
        "Medial tibial stress syndrome",
        "Tibial stress fracture"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS) (D). MTSS, also known as 'shin splints,' is characterized by lower extremity pain that occurs in individuals who have recently increased their physical activity levels. The pain is typically described as a bilateral dull ache that arises during intense physical activity and may initially dissipate during continued exercise but gradually worsens over time, eventually requiring rest for relief. Physical examination usually reveals diffuse tenderness along the medial border of the tibia without associated warmth, swelling, or skin changes. The diagnosis is clinical, and management includes reducing the patient's overall running mileage."

            "question": "A 13-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her father because of a 1-month history of pain in her right knee. She is a competitive volleyball player and has missed several games recently due to pain. Examination shows swelling distal to the right knee joint on the anterior surface of the proximal tibia; there is no overlying warmth or deformity. Extension of the right knee against resistance is painful. Which of the following structures is attached to the affected anterior tibial area?",
            "choices": [
                "Anterior cruciate ligament",
                "Patellar ligament",
                "Quadriceps tendon",

                "Pes anserinus tendon"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The correct answer is patellar ligament (B). The patellar ligament connects the patella to the tibial tuberosity and allows for full extension of the knee via the quadriceps muscle. Osgood-Schlatter disease arises due to overuse of the quadriceps muscle during a period of growth (adolescence), which puts excessive strain on the attachment of the patellar ligament at the tibial tuberosity, resulting in painful inflammation and avascular necrosis. Patients present with pain during quadriceps contraction."

She began taking levofloxacin 4 days ago for community-acquired pneumonia and takes no other medications. Physical examination shows severe tenderness, swelling, erythema, and decreased range of motion of her left ankle joint. An MRI of her left ankle shows a partial tear in the anterior talofibular ligament and a complete tear in the tendon of the muscle that originates from the lower two-thirds of the fibula's lateral surface and inserts onto the base of the fifth metatarsal bone. The affected muscle normally aids in which of the following foot movements?",
            "choices": [
                "Lateral rotation",
                "Eversion",
                "Dorsiflexion",
                "Inversion",
                "Medial rotation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The correct answer is eversion (B). The peroneus brevis muscle, located in the lateral compartment of the leg, is primarily responsible for eversion of the foot and assists in plantarflexion of the foot. Injury manifests primarily with impaired foot eversion while plantarflexion may be normal or weak. Rupture of the tendon is an uncommon severe complication of fluoroquinolones (e.g., levofloxacin), particularly in older patients."

            "question": "A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of cough and progressively worsening difficulty walking up the stairs in his apartment. He has noticed that it is easier for him to climb the stairs after he has exercised. He has also had a 4.6-kg (10-lb) weight loss over the past 6 months. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 35 years. Examination shows dry mucous membranes. The pupils are equal and react sluggishly to light. Muscle strength in the proximal lower extremity is initially 3/5 but increases to 5/5 after repeated muscle tapping. His Achilles reflex is 1+. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 5,
            "explanation": "The correct answer is Lambert-Eaton syndrome (F). Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), which is associated with small-cell lung cancer in two-thirds of cases, is caused by circulating autoantibodies that block presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels (anti-VGCC antibodies) at the neuromuscular junction. This blockage impairs acetylcholine (ACh) release, which leads to reduced or absent deep tendon reflexes and proximal muscle weakness; the latter improves during exercise as repetitive nerve stimulation increases the amount of ACh in the synaptic cleft. Patients with LEMS may also develop symptoms of autonomic dysfunction such as dry mouth, constipation, or impotence."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The correct answer is amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (A). Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) typically presents between 50–70 years of age with progressively worsening features of both upper motor neuron damage (hyperreflexia, increased muscle tone, Babinski sign) and lower motor neuron damage (hyporeflexia, decreased muscle tone, atrophy), as seen in this patient. While dysphagia from bulbar atrophy is present in approximately 20% of patients at disease onset, it is most often a late clinical feature and suggests a poor prognosis."
