    "explanation": "Osteosarcomas are caused by malignant osteoblasts that arise from mesenchymal stem cells located within the periosteum. Malignant osteoblast activity leads to increased production of osteoid matrix and formation of poorly organized bone networks. Osteosarcomas can destroy nearby structures, causing periosteal reactions that manifest as a Codman triangle and/or sunburst appearance on imaging."

    "question": "Which of the following is a benign bone tumor?",
    "choices": [
        "Ewing sarcoma",
        "Exostosis",
        "Osteoid osteoma",
        "Osteophyte",
        "Osteosarcoma"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is osteoid osteoma. This is a benign primary bone tumor that forms osteoid and bone in the long bones. Exostosis and osteophyte are non-neoplastic bony outgrowths that cause 'spurs' and can be painful, especially on weight-bearing surfaces. Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma are malignant primary bone tumors."

        "Osteoid osteoma",
        "Osteosarcoma"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is bone metastasis from prostate cancer. Secondary (metastatic) cancers of the bone are more common than any of the primary bone tumors. Ewing sarcoma is a rare malignant bone cancer seen in boys younger than 15 years. Osteoblastomas and osteoid osteomas are benign primary bone tumors. Osteosarcomas are uncommon malignant primary bone tumors."

    "question": "Which of the following is most diagnostic of osteosarcoma on an x-ray?",
    "choices": [
        "Bony exostosis with cartilaginous cap",
        "Onion-skin periosteal reaction",
        "Small tumor with well-defined margins",
        "Sunburst pattern with a Codman triangle"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is sunburst pattern with a Codman triangle. Osteosarcomas appear as a sunburst pattern with a Codman triangle due to elevation of the periosteum, leading to a triangular appearance on x-ray. A bony exostosis with cartilaginous cap is seen in an osteochondroma. Onion-skin periosteal reaction is observed in a Ewing sarcoma. A small tumor with well-defined margins represents an osteoid osteoma."

    "question": "A 50-year-old man presents to his doctor because of dull pain on his left inner thigh that has been increasing in severity over the past 6 months. The pain is exacerbated by pressure and movement. A pelvic and thigh x-ray reveals normal bone but reveals a soft-tissue mass on the inner edge of his left femur. A magnetic resonance imaging scan shows the mass to be approximately 9 × 9 × 5 cm in size, and pathologic analysis shows features of malignant cells. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
        "Leiomyoma",
        "Lipoma",
        "Liposarcoma",
        "Rhabdomyoma",
        "Rhabdomyosarcoma"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is liposarcoma. Liposarcomas are malignant tumors of adipose tissue that can cause large masses in deep soft tissue. They are rare but are the most common type of malignant sarcoma. Leiomyomas are benign tumors of smooth muscle and are most often found in the abdominal region. Lipomas are benign, usually closer to the skin, and normally smaller in size. None of the three types of rhabdomyoma are malignant. Rhabdomyosarcomas most often occur in children and typically involve the head, neck, extremities, and genitourinary regions."

{
    "question": "A 60-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with abdominal pain and abnormal bleeding from the vagina. The patient reports that she is postmenopausal and is experiencing increased frequency of constipation and urination. A computed tomography scan reveals a mass in the uterus. Surgery was performed to remove the mass, and a specimen was viewed under the microscope. Histology revealed pleomorphic smooth muscle cells, with irregular mitotic spindles. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
        "Leiomyoma",
        "Leiomyosarcoma",
        "Liposarcoma",
        "Rhabdomyoma",
        "Rhabdomyosarcoma"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is leiomyosarcoma. Both leiomyomas and leiomyosarcomas can appear in the uterus and cause similar symptoms. Constipation and frequent urination are due to the compression of the tumor against the bowels and bladder. However, the histology reveals pleomorphic smooth muscle cells with irregular mitotic spindles, which is consistent with leiomyosarcoma. Liposarcomas arise from adipose tissue, while rhabdomyomas and rhabdomyosarcomas arise from skeletal muscle cells."

        "Leiomyoma",
        "Leiomyosarcoma",
        "Myxoma",
        "Rhabdomyoma",
        "Rhabdomyosarcoma"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is rhabdomyoma. Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic condition that causes benign tumors to grow in the kidneys, heart, brain, liver, and other organs. It is frequently associated with cardiac rhabdomyomas, which can cause pain and breathing difficulties due to mass effect and disturbed blood flow. Dizziness may result from decreased blood flow or arrhythmias. Leiomyomas and leiomyosarcomas arise from smooth muscle and would not present with the patient's symptoms. Myxomas arise from primitive connective tissue and are most common in adults. Rhabdomyosarcomas are not associated with TSC and are usually found in the head, neck, extremities, and genitourinary tract."

        "Osteochondroma",
        "Osteosarcoma"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 4,

        "Chondrosarcoma",
        "Ewing sarcoma",
        "Giant cell tumor",
        "Osteochondroma",
        "Osteosarcoma"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "Giant cell tumors most frequently occur at the epiphyseal end of a long bone and most commonly in women age 20 to 40 years old. The classic radiologic findings are 'soap bubble' lesions at the epiphyses of long bones."

        "Malignant neoplastic growth of myocytes"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is benign neoplastic growth of myocytes. Uterine fibroids (leiomyomas) result from benign growth of myocytes within the uterus. Most patients are asymptomatic and present with an enlarged, firm uterus with an irregular contour. When fibroids enlarge, they can cause heavy uterine bleeding, pain, increased urinary frequency, or pelvic pressure."
