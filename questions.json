"correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "Be careful of the units on the x-axis of Flow Volume loops- they can either increase left to right (0-->10) or right to left (10<--0). This will change your interpretation of the loop. In COPD, an obstructive disease, loss of elastic recoil and destruction of alveolar walls reduce the radial traction that normally keeps airways open. This increases airway resistance, especially during expiration, leading to airflow limitation and air trapping. The result is an increase in residual volume (RV) and total lung capacity (TLC), as seen on flow-volume loops (green is normal, red is obstructive) where expiratory flow is reduced, producing a characteristic concave or 'scooped-out' appearance."

    "question": "A patient is placed on supplemental oxygen, increasing their alveolar partial pressure of oxygen (PAO2) from 100 mmHg to 500 mmHg. Which of the following best describes how this change affects the amount of dissolved oxygen in plasma?",
    "choices": [
        "The amount of dissolved oxygen increases proportionally with the rise in PO2, leading to a large increase in oxygen content.",
        "The increase in PO2 results in a small increase in dissolved oxygen, as most oxygen transport relies on hemoglobin binding.",
        "The amount of dissolved oxygen remains unchanged regardless of PO2 due to oxygen saturation limits.",
        "The oxygen content in plasma is determined solely by hemoglobin saturation, making PO2 irrelevant."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "According to Henry's law, the amount of gas dissolved in a liquid is proportional to its partial pressure. However, since oxygen is poorly soluble in plasma, even a large increase in PO2 results in only a small increase in the amount of dissolved oxygen. Most oxygen transport occurs via hemoglobin binding, not dissolution in plasma."

        ],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "The amount of O2 dissolved in blood is calculated using the equation: For each 1 mmHg PO2 there is 0.003 mL O2 dissolved in x100 mL blood. With a PaO2 of 60 mmHg: 0.003 × 60 = 0.18 mL O2 per 100 mL blood."

            "Increased H+ concentration"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 3,
        "explanation": "A leftward shift of the oxygen dissociation curve increases hemoglobin’s affinity for oxygen, making it harder to release O2 to tissues. This occurs with increased pH (alkalosis), decreased PCO2, decreased temperature, and decreased 2,3-DPG."

    "question": "A 28-year-old woman with carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning presents with confusion and cherry-red skin discoloration. Which of the following best explains why oxygen delivery is impaired in this condition?",
    "choices": [
        "CO binds to hemoglobin with high affinity, reducing hemoglobin saturation and oxygen transport",
        "CO prevents oxygen from binding and also increases hemoglobin’s affinity for O₂, making oxygen unloading at tissues more difficult",
        "CO reduces dissolved oxygen levels in plasma, limiting O₂ transport",
        "CO shifts the oxygen dissociation curve to the right, decreasing hemoglobin’s ability to bind O₂",
        "CO induces methemoglobinemia, preventing oxygen transport"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "CO poisoning impairs oxygen delivery by binding to hemoglobin with 250× the affinity of O₂, reducing available hemoglobin for oxygen transport. Additionally, CO increases hemoglobin’s affinity for O₂, shifting the dissociation curve leftward and preventing oxygen unloading at tissues, leading to functional anemia and tissue hypoxia. Treat with 100% O2"

            "Decreased temperature",
            "Increased pH",
            "Increased 2,3-BPG",

            "Leftward shift favoring oxygen loading"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 2,
        "explanation": "A rightward shift of the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve enhances oxygen unloading at tissues. This occurs with increased CO2, increased temperature, increased 2,3-BPG, and decreased pH (Bohr effect). 2,3-BPG binds to deoxygenated hemoglobin, stabilizing the T-state and promoting O2 release."

    "question": "A 45-year-old man presents to the emergency department with fatigue, dizziness, and cyanosis that does not improve with supplemental oxygen. He recently started taking nitroglycerin for angina. Arterial blood gas analysis shows a normal PaO₂, but pulse oximetry reveals low oxygen saturation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his symptoms?",
    "choices": [
        "Carbon monoxide poisoning",
        "Methemoglobinemia induced by nitroglycerin",
        "Iron deficiency anemia",
        "Pulmonary embolism",
        "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Nitroglycerin and other nitrate drugs can oxidize Fe²⁺ (ferrous) in hemoglobin to Fe³⁺ (ferric), forming methemoglobin, which cannot bind oxygen effectively. This leads to functional anemia and cyanosis that does not correct with supplemental oxygen. The standard treatment is methylene blue, which acts as an electron donor to reduce Fe³⁺ back to Fe²⁺, restoring hemoglobin’s oxygen-carrying capacity."

            "Calcium (Ca2+)"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "CO2 + H2O→ H2CO3 →(H+) + (HCO3-). HCO3- diffuses into plasma from RBCs, but H+ cannot diffuse easily. The chloride shift occurs when HCO3- diffuses out of RBCs, leading to the influx of chloride (Cl-) into RBCs to maintain electrical neutrality due to the proton concentration. This process is reversed in the lungs (Haldane effect), where increased O2 with Hb releases H+, shifting the initial chemical equation equilibrium (HCO3- will dissociate into CO2 and H20, increasing PCO2 in alveoli)."

            "Prevents bicarbonate from forming in RBCs"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "Hyperventilation lowers PCO2 and H+ levels, shifting the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve to the right, which enhances oxygen unloading at tissues. This is part of the Bohr effect, where increased H+ (low pH) promotes O2 release."

            "Cerebrospinal fluid"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "CO2 is released from the blood in the pulmonary capillaries, where bicarbonate (HCO3-) is converted back into CO2 for exhalation. About 70% of CO2 transport occurs as bicarbonate, which undergoes reversal of the chloride shift in the lungs."

            "Decreased production of carbaminohemoglobin"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "Haldane effect: When oxygen binds to hemoglobin, hemoglobin becomes a stronger acid and releases H+ ions, which shift the bicarbonate reaction to the left (HCO3- + H+ → CO2 + H2O). This increases PCO2, which then diffuses into the alveoli. In patients with COPD, excessive oxygen therapy reduces their drive to breathe, further increasing CO2 retention."
