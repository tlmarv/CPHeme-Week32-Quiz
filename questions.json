    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is osteoid osteoma. This is a benign primary bone tumor that forms osteoid and bone in the long bones. Exostosis and osteophyte are non-neoplastic bony outgrowths that cause 'spurs' and can be painful, especially on weight-bearing surfaces. Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma are malignant primary bone tumors."

    "question": "Which of the following bone tumors is most common?",
    "choices": [
        "Bone metastases from prostate cancer",
        "Ewing sarcoma",
        "Osteoblastoma",
        "Osteoid osteoma",
        "Osteosarcoma"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is bone metastasis from prostate cancer. Secondary (metastatic) cancers of the bone are more common than any of the primary bone tumors. Ewing sarcoma is a rare malignant bone cancer seen in boys younger than 15 years. Osteoblastomas and osteoid osteomas are benign primary bone tumors. Osteosarcomas are uncommon malignant primary bone tumors."

{
    "question": "Which of the following is most diagnostic of osteosarcoma on an x-ray?",
    "choices": [
        "Bony exostosis with cartilaginous cap",
        "Onion-skin periosteal reaction",
        "Small tumor with well-defined margins",
        "Sunburst pattern with a Codman triangle"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is sunburst pattern with a Codman triangle. Osteosarcomas appear as a sunburst pattern with a Codman triangle due to elevation of the periosteum, leading to a triangular appearance on x-ray. A bony exostosis with cartilaginous cap is seen in an osteochondroma. Onion-skin periosteal reaction is observed in a Ewing sarcoma. A small tumor with well-defined margins represents an osteoid osteoma."

    "question": "A 50-year-old man presents to his doctor because of dull pain on his left inner thigh that has been increasing in severity over the past 6 months. The pain is exacerbated by pressure and movement. A pelvic and thigh x-ray reveals normal bone but reveals a soft-tissue mass on the inner edge of his left femur. A magnetic resonance imaging scan shows the mass to be approximately 9 × 9 × 5 cm in size, and pathologic analysis shows features of malignant cells. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
        "Leiomyoma",
        "Lipoma",
        "Liposarcoma",
        "Rhabdomyoma",
        "Rhabdomyosarcoma"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is liposarcoma. Liposarcomas are malignant tumors of adipose tissue that can cause large masses in deep soft tissue. They are rare but are the most common type of malignant sarcoma. Leiomyomas are benign tumors of smooth muscle and are most often found in the abdominal region. Lipomas are benign, usually closer to the skin, and normally smaller in size. None of the three types of rhabdomyoma are malignant. Rhabdomyosarcomas most often occur in children and typically involve the head, neck, extremities, and genitourinary regions."

    "question": "A 60-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with abdominal pain and abnormal bleeding from the vagina. The patient reports that she is postmenopausal and is experiencing increased frequency of constipation and urination. A computed tomography scan reveals a mass in the uterus. Surgery was performed to remove the mass, and a specimen was viewed under the microscope. Histology revealed pleomorphic smooth muscle cells, with irregular mitotic spindles. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
        "Leiomyoma",
        "Leiomyosarcoma",
        "Liposarcoma",
        "Rhabdomyoma",
        "Rhabdomyosarcoma"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is leiomyosarcoma. Both leiomyomas and leiomyosarcomas can appear in the uterus and cause similar symptoms. Constipation and frequent urination are due to the compression of the tumor against the bowels and bladder. However, the histology reveals pleomorphic smooth muscle cells with irregular mitotic spindles, which is consistent with leiomyosarcoma. Liposarcomas arise from adipose tissue, while rhabdomyomas and rhabdomyosarcomas arise from skeletal muscle cells."

    "question": "A 12-year-old boy with a known family history of tuberous sclerosis complex presents to his physician with chest pain, breathing difficulties, and dizziness. An echocardiogram shows a mass in his left atrium. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
        "Leiomyoma",
        "Leiomyosarcoma",
        "Myxoma",
        "Rhabdomyoma",
        "Rhabdomyosarcoma"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is rhabdomyoma. Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic condition that causes benign tumors to grow in the kidneys, heart, brain, liver, and other organs. It is frequently associated with cardiac rhabdomyomas, which can cause pain and breathing difficulties due to mass effect and disturbed blood flow. Dizziness may result from decreased blood flow or arrhythmias. Leiomyomas and leiomyosarcomas arise from smooth muscle and would not present with the patient's symptoms. Myxomas arise from primitive connective tissue and are most common in adults. Rhabdomyosarcomas are not associated with TSC and are usually found in the head, neck, extremities, and genitourinary tract."

    "question": "A 17-year-old boy comes to the clinic for pain above his right knee for the past few months. The pain is worse at night and anti-inflammatory medications have not provided symptomatic relief. His family history includes an ocular cancer in his younger sister. On physical examination, there is a localized swelling above the knee and his right knee is tender to palpation. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
        "B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia",
        "Chondrosarcoma",
        "Ewing sarcoma",
        "Osteochondroma",
        "Osteosarcoma"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 4,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is osteosarcoma. Osteosarcoma should be considered in teenagers with localized swelling and pain at the metaphyseal region of long bones. It is associated with a predisposition for malignancy, especially in the setting of a family history of cancer."

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman comes to the physician because of severe left knee pain that has persisted for the past several months. There is no history of trauma to the knee. Physical examination of the left knee reveals a tender effusion. X-ray reveals a lesion at the distal femoral epiphysis. The lesion is expansile, osteolytic, and radiolucent with a nonsclerotic, sharply defined border. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
        "Chondrosarcoma",
        "Ewing sarcoma",
        "Giant cell tumor",
        "Osteochondroma",
        "Osteosarcoma"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "Giant cell tumors most frequently occur at the epiphyseal end of a long bone and most commonly in women age 20 to 40 years old. The classic radiologic findings are 'soap bubble' lesions at the epiphyses of long bones."

    "question": "A 32-year-old nulligravid woman comes to the gynecologist for her annual well-woman checkup. On examination, there is an enlarged, firm, and nodular mass in her abdomen. She mentions feeling a sense of fullness in her lower abdomen and occasional urinary frequency but no other symptoms. The diagnosis is confirmed by transabdominal ultrasonography. Which of the following uterine abnormalities is the most likely cause of her condition?",
    "choices": [
        "Benign neoplastic growth of endometrial cells",
        "Benign neoplastic growth of myocytes",
        "Invasion of endometrial glandular cells into the myometrium",
        "Malignant neoplastic growth of endometrial cells",
        "Malignant neoplastic growth of myocytes"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is benign neoplastic growth of myocytes. Uterine fibroids (leiomyomas) result from benign growth of myocytes within the uterus. Most patients are asymptomatic and present with an enlarged, firm uterus with an irregular contour. When fibroids enlarge, they can cause heavy uterine bleeding, pain, increased urinary frequency, or pelvic pressure."
